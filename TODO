to do list

DOCBOOK XML todo

1. Find a way to integrate url's into the docbook xml.
It would be nice to reference to url's in the text, and have somewhere (appendix?) a list of url's.

e.g https://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/linuxkerneldevelopment.php could be linked from the "Linux" section in intro_to_unix.

2. Have a seperate index of people mentionned in the text

3. Have a seperate index of files
not so urgent since they are all at the beginning of the index because they all start with /

4. Is there a better alternative? Have a look at reST, editing with Spinx, can be converted to from Docbook
