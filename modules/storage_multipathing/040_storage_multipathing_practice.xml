<section><title>Practice: multipathing</title>
	<para>1. Find a partner and decide who will be iSCSI Target and who will be iSCSI Initiator and Multipather. Set up Multipath as we did in the theory.</para>
	<para>2. Uncomment the big 'defaults' section in /etc/multipath.conf and disable friendly names. Verify that multipath can work. You may need to check the manual for <command>/lib/dev/scsi_id</command> and for <command>multipath.conf</command>.</para>
