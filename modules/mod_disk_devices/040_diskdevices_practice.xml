<section><title>practice: hard disk devices</title>
	<para><command>About this lab:</command> To practice working with hard disks, you will need some hard disks. When there are no physical hard disk available, you can use virtual disks in <command>vmware</command> or <command>VirtualBox</command>. The teacher will help you in attaching a couple of ATA and/or SCSI disks to a virtual machine. The results of this lab can be used in the next three labs (partitions, file systems, mounting). It is adviced to attach at least one <command>ide</command> and three equally sized <command>scsi</command> disks to the virtual machine.</para>
	<para>1. Use <command>dmesg</command> to make a list of hard disk devices detected at boot-up.</para>
	<para>2. Use <command>fdisk</command> to find the total size of all hard disk devices on your system.</para>
	<para>3. Stop a virtual machine, add three virtual 1 gigabyte <command>scsi</command> hard disk devices and one virtual 400 megabyte <command>ide</command> hard disk device. If possible, also add another virtual 400 megabyte <command>ide</command> disk.</para>
	<para>4. Use <command>dmesg</command> to verify that all the new disks are properly detected at boot-up.</para>
	<para>5. Verify that you can see the disk devices in <command>/dev</command>.</para>
	<para>6. Use <command>fdisk</command> (with <command>grep</command> and <command>/dev/null</command>) to display the total size of the new disks.</para>
	<para>7. Use <command>badblocks</command> to completely erase one of the smaller hard disks.</para>
	<para>8. Look at <command>/proc/scsi/scsi</command>.</para>
	<para>9. If possible, install <command>lsscsi</command> and use it to list the <command>scsi</command> disks.</para>
