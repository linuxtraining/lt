<section><title>; semicolon</title>
	<para>You can put two or more commands on the same line separated by a semicolon <command>;</command><indexterm><primary>; (shell)</primary></indexterm> . The shell will scan the line until it reaches the semicolon. All the arguments before this semicolon will be considered a separate command from all the arguments after the semicolon. Both series will be executed sequentially with the shell waiting for each command to finish before starting the next one.</para>

<section><title>&#038; ampersand</title>
	<para>When a line ends with an ampersand <command>&#038;</command><indexterm><primary>&#038;</primary></indexterm>, the shell will not wait for the command to finish. You will get your shell prompt back, and the command is executed in background. You will get a message when this command has finished executing in background.</para>

<section><title>$? dollar question mark</title>
	<para>The exit code of the previous command is stored in the shell variable <command>$?</command>. Actually <command>$?</command><indexterm><primary>$? (shell variables)</primary></indexterm> is a shell parameter and not a variable, since you cannot assign a value to <command>$?</command>.</para>

	<para>The shell will interpret <command>&#038;&#038;</command><indexterm><primary>&#038;&#038;</primary></indexterm> as a <command>logical AND</command>. When using <command>&#038;&#038;</command> the second command is executed only if the first one succeeds (returns a zero exit status). </para>

<section><title>combining &#038;&#038; and ||</title>
	<para>You can use this logical AND and logical OR to write an <command>if-then-else</command> structure on the command line. This example uses <command>echo</command> to display whether the <command>rm</command> command was successful.</para>
