<section><title>practice : more scripting</title>
	<para>1. Write a script that asks for two numbers, and outputs the sum and product (as shown here).</para>
	<screen>Enter a number: 5
Enter another number: 2

Sum:       5 + 2 = 7
Product:   5 x 2 = 10
	</screen>
	<para>2. Improve the previous script to test that the numbers are between 1 and 100, exit with an error if necessary.</para>
	<para>3. Improve the previous script to congratulate the user if the sum equals the product.</para>
	<para>4. Write a script with a case insensitive case statement, using the shopt nocasematch option. The nocasematch option is reset to the value it had before the scripts started.</para>
	<para>5. If time permits (or if you are waiting for other students to finish this practice), take a look at Linux system scripts in /etc/init.d and /etc/rc.d and try to understand them. Where does execution of a script start in /etc/init.d/samba ? There are also some hidden scripts in ~, we will discuss them later.</para>
