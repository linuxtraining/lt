<section><title>solution : more scripting</title>
	<para>1. Write a script that asks for two numbers, and outputs the sum and product (as shown here).</para>
	<screen>Enter a number: 5
Enter another number: 2

Sum:       5 + 2 = 7
Product:   5 x 2 = 10
	</screen>
	<screen>#!/bin/bash

echo -n "Enter a number : "
read n1

echo -n "Enter another number : "
read n2

let sum="$n1+$n2"
let pro="$n1*$n2"

echo -e "Sum\t: $n1 + $n2 = $sum" 
echo -e "Product\t: $n1 * $n2 = $pro"</screen>
	<para>2. Improve the previous script to test that the numbers are between 1 and 100, exit with an error if necessary.</para>
	<screen>echo -n "Enter a number between 1 and 100 : "
read n1

if [ $n1 -lt 1 -o $n1 -gt 100 ]
then
       echo Wrong number... 
       exit 1
fi</screen>
	<para>3. Improve the previous script to congratulate the user if the sum equals the product.</para>
	<screen>if [ $sum -eq $pro ] 
then echo Congratulations $sum == $pro
fi</screen>
	<para>4. Write a script with a case insensitive case statement, using the shopt nocasematch option. The nocasematch option is reset to the value it had before the scripts started.</para>
	<screen>#!/bin/bash
#
# Wild Animals Case Insensitive Helpdesk Advice
#

if shopt -q nocasematch; then
  nocase=yes;
else
  nocase=no;
  shopt -s nocasematch;
fi

echo -n "What animal did you see ? "
read animal

case $animal in
		"lion" | "tiger")
				echo "You better start running fast!"
		;;
		"cat")
				echo "Let that mouse go..."
		;;
		"dog")
				echo "Don't worry, give it a cookie."
		;;
		"chicken" | "goose" | "duck" )
				echo "Eggs for breakfast!"
		;;
		"liger")
				echo "Approach and say 'Ah you big fluffy kitty.'"
		;;
		"babelfish")
				echo "Did it fall out your ear ?"
		;;
		*)
				echo "You discovered an unknown animal, name it!"
		;;
esac

if [ nocase = yes ] ; then
        shopt -s nocasematch;
else
        shopt -u nocasematch;
fi</screen>
	<para>5. If time permits (or if you are waiting for other students to finish this practice), take a look at Linux system scripts in /etc/init.d and /etc/rc.d and try to understand them. Where does execution of a script start in /etc/init.d/samba ? There are also some hidden scripts in ~, we will discuss them later.</para>
