	<para>1. Does the file <command>/bin/cat</command> exist ? What about <command>/bin/dd</command> and <command>/bin/echo</command>. What is the type of these files ?</para>
	<para>2. What is the size of the Linux kernel file(s) (vmlinu*) in <command>/boot</command> ?</para>
	<para>3. Create a directory ~/test. Then issue the following commands:</para>
	<screen>cd ~/test</screen>
	<screen>dd if=/dev/zero of=zeroes.txt count=1 bs=100</screen>
	<screen>od zeroes.txt</screen>
	<para><command>dd</command> will copy one times (count=1) a block of size 100 bytes (bs=100) from the file <command>/dev/zero</command> to ~/test/zeroes.txt. Can you describe the functionality of <command>/dev/zero</command> ?</para>
	<para>4. Now issue the following command:</para>
	<screen>dd if=/dev/random of=random.txt count=1 bs=100 ; od random.txt</screen>
	<para><command>dd</command> will copy one times (count=1) a block of size 100 bytes (bs=100) from the file <command>/dev/random</command> to ~/test/random.txt. Can you describe the functionality of <command>/dev/random</command> ?</para>
	<para>5. Issue the following two commands, and look at the first character of each output line.</para>
	<screen>ls -l /dev/sd* /dev/hd*</screen>
	<screen>ls -l /dev/tty* /dev/input/mou*</screen>
	<para>The first ls will show block(b) devices, the second ls shows character(c) devices. Can you tell the difference between block and character devices ?</para>
	<para>6. Use cat to display <command>/etc/hosts</command> and <command>/etc/resolv.conf</command>. What is your idea about the purpose of these files ?</para>
	<para>7. Are there any files in <command>/etc/skel/</command> ? Check also for hidden files.</para>
	<para>8. Display <command>/proc/cpuinfo</command>. On what architecture is your Linux running ?</para>
	<para>9. Display <command>/proc/interrupts</command>. What is the size of this file ? Where is this file stored ?</para>
	<para>10. Can you enter the <command>/root</command> directory ? Are there (hidden) files ?</para>
	<para>11. Are ifconfig, fdisk, parted, shutdown and grub-install present in <command>/sbin</command> ? Why are these binaries in <command>/sbin</command> and not in <command>/bin</command> ?</para>
	<para>12. Is <command>/var/log</command> a file or a directory ? What about <command>/var/spool</command> ?</para>
	<para>13. Open two command prompts (Ctrl-Shift-T in gnome-terminal) or terminals (Ctrl-Alt-F1, Ctrl-Alt-F2, ...) and issue the <command>who am i</command> in both. Then try to echo a word from one terminal to the other.</para>
	<para>14. Read the man page of <command>random</command> and explain the difference between <command>/dev/random</command> and <command>/dev/urandom</command><indexterm><primary>/dev/urandom</primary></indexterm>.</para>
