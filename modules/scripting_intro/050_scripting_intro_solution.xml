	<para>0. Give each script a different name, keep them for later!</para>
	<para>1. Write a script that outputs the name of a city.</para>
	<screen>$ echo 'echo Antwerp' > first.bash
$ chmod +x first.bash 
$ ./first.bash 
Antwerp</screen>
	<para>2. Make sure the script runs in the bash shell.</para>
	<screen>$ cat first.bash
#!/bin/bash
echo Antwerp</screen>
<para>3. Make sure the script runs in the Korn shell.</para>
	<screen>$ cat first.bash
#!/bin/ksh
echo Antwerp</screen>
	<para>Note that while first.bash will technically work as a Korn shell script, the name ending in .bash is confusing.</para>
	<para>4. Create a script that defines two variables, and outputs their value.</para>
	<screen>$ cat second.bash
#!/bin/bash

var33=300
var42=400

echo $var33 $var42</screen>
	<para>5. The previous script does not influence your current shell (the variables do not exist outside of the script). Now run the script so that it influences your current shell.</para>
	<screen>source second.bash</screen>
	<para>6. Is there a shorter way to <command>source</command> the script ?</para>
	<screen>. ./second.bash</screen>
	<para>7. Comment your scripts so that others may know what they are working with.</para>
	<screen>$ cat second.bash
#!/bin/bash
# script to test variables and sourcing

# define two variables
var33=300
var42=400

# output the value of these variables
echo $var33 $var42</screen>
