<para>Users can be listed in <command>groups</command><indexterm><primary>groups</primary></indexterm>. Groups allow you to set permissions on the group level instead of having to set permissions for every individual user.</para>
<para>Every Unix or Linux distribution will have a graphical tool to manage groups. Novice users are advised to use this graphical tool. More experienced users can use command line tools to manage users, but be careful: Some distributions do not allow the mixed use of GUI and CLI tools to manage groups (YaST in Novell Suse). Senior administrators can edit the relevant files directly with <command>vi</command> or <command>vigr</command>.</para>
