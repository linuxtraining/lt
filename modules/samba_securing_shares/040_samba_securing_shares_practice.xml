<section><title>Practice: securing shares</title>
	<para>1. Create a writable share called sales, and a readonly share called budget. Test that it works.</para>
	<para>2. Limit access to the sales share to ann, sandra and veronique.</para>
	<para>3. Make sure that roberto cannot access the sales share.</para>
	<para>4. Even though the sales share is writable, ann should only have read access.</para>
	<para>5. Even though the budget share is read only, sandra should also have write access.</para>
	<para>6. Limit one shared directory to the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, and another share to the two computers with ip-addresses 192.168.1.33 and 172.17.18.19.</para>
	<para>7. Make sure the computer with ip 192.168.1.203 cannot access the budget share.</para>
	<para>8. Make sure (on the budget share) that users can see only files and directories to which they have access.</para>
	<para>9. Make sure the sales share is not visible when browsing the network.</para>
	<para>10. All files created in the sales share should have 640 permissions or less.</para>
	<para>11. All directories created in the budget share should have 750 permissions or more.</para>
	<para>12. Permissions for files on the sales share should never be set more than 664.</para>
	<para>13. Permissions for files on the budget share should never be set less than 500.</para>
	<para>14. If time permits (or if you are waiting for other students to finish this practice), then combine the "read only" and "writable" statements to check which one has priority.</para>
	<para>15. If time permits then combine "read list", "write list", "hosts allow" and "hosts deny". Which of these has priority ?</para>
