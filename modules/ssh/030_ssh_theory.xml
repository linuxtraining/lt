These older protocols do not encrypt the login session, which means your user id and password can be sniffed by tools like <command>wireshark</command><indexterm><primary>wireshark</primary></indexterm> or <command>tcpdump</command>. To securely connect to your servers, use <command>ssh</command><indexterm><primary>openssh</primary></indexterm>.</para>
	<para>The <command>ssh protocol</command> is secure in two ways. Firstly the connection is <command>encrypted</command> and secondly the connection is <command>authenticated</command> both ways.</para>
	<para>An ssh connection always starts with a cryptographic handshake, followed by <command>encryption</command> of the transport layer using a symmetric cypher. In other words, the tunnel is encrypted before you start typing anything.</para>
	<para>Then <command>authentication</command> takes place (using user id/password or public/private keys) and communication can begin over the encrypted connection.</para>

<section><title>setting up passwordless ssh</title>
	<para>To set up passwordless ssh authentication through public/private keys, use <command>ssh-keygen</command> to generate a key pair without a passphrase, and then copy your public key to the destination server. Let's do this step by step.</para>
	<para>In the example that follows, we will set up ssh without password between Alice and Bob. Alice has an account on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server, Bob is using Ubuntu on his laptop. Bob wants to give Alice access using ssh and the public and private key system. This means that even if Bob changes his password on his laptop, Alice will still have access.</para>
<section><title>ssh-keygen</title>
	<para>The example below shows how Alice uses <command>ssh-keygen</command><indexterm><primary>ssh-keygen(1)</primary></indexterm> to generate a key pair. Alice does not enter a passphrase.</para>
	<screen>[alice@RHEL5 ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Enter file in which to save the key (/home/alice/.ssh/id_rsa):

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again:

Your public key has been saved in /home/alice/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

If you create the <command>.ssh</command> directory manually, then you need to chmod 700 it! Otherwise ssh will refuse to use the keys (world readable private keys are not secure!).</para>
		<para>As you can see, the <command>.ssh</command> directory is secure in Alice's home directory.</para>
