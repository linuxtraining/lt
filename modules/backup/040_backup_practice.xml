<section><title>Practice: backup</title>
	<para>!! Careful with tar options and the position of the backup file, mistakes can destroy your system!!</para>
	<para>1. Create a directory (or partition if you like) for backups. Link (or mount) it under /mnt/backup.</para>
	<para>2a. Use tar to backup /etc in /mnt/backup/etc_date.tgz, the backup must be gzipped. (Replace date with the current date)</para>
	<para>2b. Use tar to backup /bin to /mnt/backup/bin_date.tar.bz2, the backup must be bzip2'd.</para>
	<para>2c. Choose a file in /etc and /bin and verify with tar that the file is indeed backed up.</para>
	<para>2d. Extract those two files to your home directory.</para>
	<para>3a. Create a backup directory for your neighbour, make it accessible under /mnt/neighbourName</para>
	<para>3b. Combine ssh and tar to put a backup of your /boot on your neighbours computer in /mnt/YourName</para>
	<para>4a. Combine find and cpio to create a cpio archive of /etc.</para>
	<para>4b. Choose a file in /etc and restore it from the cpio archive into your home directory.</para>	
	<para>5. Use dd and ssh to put a backup of the master boot record on your neighbours computer.</para>	
	<para>6. (On the real computer) Create and mount an ISO image of the ubuntu cdrom.</para>	
	<para>7. Combine dd and gzip to create a 'ghost' image of one of your partitions on another partition.</para>	
	<para>8. Use dd to create a five megabyte file in ~/testsplit and name it biggest. Then split this file in smaller two megabyte parts.</para>    
	<screen>mkdir testsplit</screen>
	<screen>dd if=/dev/zero of=~/testsplit/biggest count=5000 bs=1024</screen>
	<screen>split -b 2000000 biggest parts</screen>
