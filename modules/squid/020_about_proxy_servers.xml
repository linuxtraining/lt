<section><title>usage</title>
	<para>A <command>proxy server</command><indexterm><primary>proxy server</primary></indexterm> is a server that caches the internet. Clients connect to the proxy server with a request for an internet server. The proxy server will connect to the internet server on behalf of the client. The proxy server will also cache the pages retrieved from the internet server. A proxy server may provide pages from his cache to a client, instead of connecting to the internet server to retrieve the (same) pages.</para>
	<para>A proxy server has two main advantages. It improves web surfing speed when returning cached data to clients, and it reduces the required bandwidth (cost) to the internet.</para>
	<para>Smaller organizations sometimes put the proxy server on the same physical computer that serves as a NAT to the internet. In larger organizations, the proxy server is one of many servers in the DMZ.</para>
	<para>When web traffic passes via a proxy server, it is common practice to configure the proxy with extra settings for access control. Access control in a proxy server can mean user account access, but also website(url), ip-address or dns restrictions.</para>

<section><title>open proxy servers</title>
	<para>You can find lists of open proxy servers on the internet that enable you to surf anonymously. This works when the proxy server connects on your behalf to a website, without logging your ip-address. But be careful, these (listed) open proxy servers could be created in order to eavesdrop upon their users.</para>
