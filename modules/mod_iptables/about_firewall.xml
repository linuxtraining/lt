<section><title>router or firewall</title>
	<para>A router is a device that connects two networks. A firewall is a device that besides acting as a router, also contains (and implements) rules to determine whether packets are allowed to travel from one network to another. A firewall can be configured to block access based on networks, hosts, protocols and ports. Firewalls can also change the contents of packets while forwarding them.</para>
