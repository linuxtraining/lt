	<para>1. Put a sorted list of all bash users in bashusers.txt.</para>
	<screen>grep bash /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1 | sort &#062; bashusers.txt</screen>
	<para>2. Put a sorted list of all logged on users in onlineusers.txt.</para>
	<screen>who | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort &#062; onlineusers.txt</screen>
	<para>3. Make a list of all filenames in <command>/etc</command> that contain the string <command>conf</command> in their filename.</para>
	<screen>ls /etc | grep conf</screen>
	<para>4. Make a sorted list of all files in <command>/etc</command> that contain the case insensitive string <command>conf</command> in their filename.</para>
	<screen>ls /etc | grep -i conf | sort</screen>
	<para>5. Look at the output of <command>/sbin/ifconfig</command>. Write a line that displays only ip address and the subnet mask.</para>
	<screen>/sbin/ifconfig | head -2 | grep 'inet ' | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f3,5</screen>
	<para>6. Write a line that removes all non-letters from a stream.</para>
	<screen>paul@deb106:~$ cat text
This is, yes really! , a text with ?&#038;* too many str$ange# characters ;-)
paul@deb106:~$ cat text | tr -d ',!$?.*&#038;^%#@;()-'
This is yes really  a text with  too many strange characters
	</screen>
	<para>7. Write a line that receives a text file, and outputs all words on a separate line.</para>
	<screen>
paul@deb106:~$ cat text2 
it is very cold today without the sun

paul@deb106:~$ cat text2 | tr ' ' '\n'
it
is
very
cold
today
without
the
sun
	</screen>
	<para>8. Write a spell checker on the command line. (There may be a dictionary in <command>/usr/share/dict/</command> .)</para>
	<screen>
paul@rhel ~$ echo "The zun is shining today" > text

paul@rhel ~$ cat > DICT
is
shining
sun
the
today

paul@rhel ~$ cat text | tr 'A-Z ' 'a-z\n' | sort | uniq | comm -23 - DICT
zun
	</screen>
	<para>You could also add the solution from question number 6 to remove non-letters, and <command>tr -s ' '</command> to remove redundant spaces.</para>
