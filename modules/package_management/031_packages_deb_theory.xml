		<para>Most people use <command>aptitude</command> or <command>apt-get</command> to manage their Debian/Ubuntu family of Linux distributions. Both are a front end for <command>dpkg</command> and are themselves a back end for <command>synaptic</command> and other graphical tools.</para>

		<para>The low level tool to work with <command>.deb</command> packages is <command>dpkg</command><indexterm><primary>dpkg(8)</primary></indexterm>. Here you see how to obtain a list of all installed packages on a Debian server.</para>

		<para>You could use <command>dpkg -i</command> to install a package and <command>dpkg -r</command> to remove a package, but you'd have to manually keep track of dependencies. Using <command>apt-get</command> or <command>aptitude</command> is much easier.</para>

<section><title>apt-get</title>
	<para><command>Debian</command> has been using <command>apt-get</command><indexterm><primary>apt-get(8)</primary></indexterm> to manage packages since 1998. Today Debian and many Debian-based distributions still actively support <command>apt-get</command>, though some experts claim <command>aptitude</command> is better at handling dependencies than <command>apt-get</command>.</para>
	<para>Both commands use the same configuration files and can be used alternately; whenever you see <command>apt-get</command> in documentation, feel free to type <command>aptitude</command>.</para>
	<para>We will start with <command>apt-get</command> and discuss <command>aptitude</command> in the next section.</para>
	<section><title>apt-get update</title>
		<para>When typing <command>apt-get update</command> you are downloading the names, versions and short description of all packages available on all configured repositories for your system.</para>
		<para>In the example below you can see some repositories at the url <command>be.archive.ubuntu.com</command> because this computer was installed in Belgium. This url can be different for you.</para>
