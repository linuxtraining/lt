<section><title>example: DNS round robin</title>
	<para>When you create multiple A records for the same name, then <command>bind</command><indexterm><primary>bind(DNS)</primary></indexterm> will do a <command>round robin</command> of the order in which the records are returned. This allows the use of DNS as a load balancer between hosts, since clients will usually take the first ip-address offered.</para>
	<para>Consider this example from the <command>/etc/bind/db.paul.local</command> zone configuration file. There are two A records for <command>www</command> pointing to two distinct ip addresses.</para>
	<screen>root@debian10:~# <command>grep www /etc/bind/db.paul.local</command>
www             IN      A       10.104.33.30
www             IN      A       10.104.33.31</screen>
	<para>Below a screenshot of <command>nslookup</command> querying a load balanced A record. Notice the order of ip addresses returned.</para>

<?hard-pagebreak?>
<section><title>example: DNS delegation</title>
	<para>We have another <command>Linux server</command> named <command>debian10b</command> and we want to make it responsible for the child domain <command>test42.paul.local</command>.</para>
	<para><emphasis>Note the name of the servers in the screenshots are either <command>debian10</command> (hosting the parent domain) or <command>debian10b</command> (hosting the child domain).</emphasis></para>
	<para>We start by adjusting the <command>/etc/bind/named.comf.local</command> file (on the server hosting the parent domain) to make sure that no forwarder will be used when resolving authoritative names.</para>
	<screen>root@debian10:~# <command>grep -A4 paul.local /etc/bind/named.conf.local</command>
zone "paul.local" IN {

	<para>Technically, you could also set <command>allow-transfer</command> to <command>{ any; };</command> while troubleshooting and then refine it later, but this is not needed for delegation.</para>

<section><title>example: split-horizon dns</title>
	<para>Suppose you want to answer dns queries depending on who is asking. For example when someone from the 10.104.15.0/24 network (managed by Jesse) asks for the A record www.paul.local, then dns answers with 10.104.33.30. But when someone from the 10.104.42.0/24 network (managed by Keith) asks for the same A record of www.paul.local, he will get 10.104.33.31 as an answer.</para>
	<para>A <command>split-horizon</command> setup can be used to redirect people to <command>local</command> copies of certain services.</para>
	<para>In this example we want to decide on specific answers for two networks (Jesse's and Keith's) and prevent them from using our dns server for <command>recursion</command>, while maintaining the capability to resolve the internet and our paul.local zone from our own network.</para>

<section><title>old DNS load balancing</title>
	<para>Not as above. When you have more than one DNS server authoritative for a zone, you can spread queries amongst all server. One way to do this is by creating NS records for all servers that participate in the load balancing of external queries.</para>
	<para>You could also configure different name servers on internal clients.</para>
</section>
<section><title>old DNS notify</title>
	<para>The original design of DNS in rfc 1034 and rfc 1035 implemented a <command>refresh</command> time in the <command>SOA</command> record to configure a time loop for slaves to query their master server. This can result in a lot of useless pull requests, or in a significant lag between updates.</para>
	<para>For this reason <command>dns notify (rfc 1996)</command> was designed. The server will now notify slaves whenever there is an update. By default this feature is activated in <command>bind</command>.</para>

<section><title>old DDNS integration with DHCP</title>
	<para>Some organizations like to have all their client computers in DNS. This can be cumbersome to maintain. Luckily <command>rfc 2136</command> describes integration of DHCP servers with a DNS server. Whenever DHCP acknowledges a client ip configuration, it can notify DNS with this clients ip-address and name. This is called <command>dynamic updates</command> or DDNS.</para>

<section><title>old reverse is forward in-addr.arpa</title>
	<para>Reverse lookup is actually iomplemented as a forward lookup in the <command>in-addr.arpa</command> domain. This domain has 256 child domains (from 0.in-addr.arpa to 255.in-addr.arpa), with each child domain having again 256 child domains.

There is the AAAA record for ipv6 hosts on the network, and there is the <command>ip6.int</command> domain for reverse lookup (having 16 child domains from 0.ip6.int to f.ip6.int, each of those having again 16 child domains...and this 16 times.</para>
