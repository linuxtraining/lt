		<para>Development of this protocol was started by <command>IBM</command><indexterm><primary>IBM</primary></indexterm> in the early eighties. By the end of the eighties, most develpment was done by <command>Microsoft</command>. SMB is an application level protocol designed to run on top of NetBIOS/NetBEUI, but can also be run on top of tcp/ip.</para>
		<para>In 1996 Microsoft was asked to document the protocol. They submitted CIFS (Common Internet File System) as an internet draft, but it never got final rfc status.</para>
		<para>In 2004 the European Union decided Microsoft should document the protocol to enable other developers to write compatible software. December 20th 2007 Microsoft came to an agreement. The Samba team now has access to SMB/CIFS, Windows for Workgroups and Active Directory documentation.</para>
