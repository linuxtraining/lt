<section><title>set up a directory to share</title>
	<para>In this second example, we will create a share where everyone can create files and write to files. Again, we start by creating a directory</para>
	<screen>
[root@RHEL52 samba]# mkdir -p /srv/samba/writable
[root@RHEL52 samba]# chmod 777 /srv/samba/writable/
	</screen>
</section>
<section><title>configure the share</title>
	<para>Then we simply add a share to our file server by editing <command>smb.conf</command><indexterm><primary>/etc/samba/smb.conf</primary></indexterm>. Below the check with testparm. (We could have changed the description of the server...)</para>

[root@RHEL52 samba]# testparm
Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf

<section><title>test connection with windows</title>
	<para>We can now test the connection on a windows 2003 computer. We use the <command>net use</command><indexterm><primary>net use(microsoft)</primary></indexterm> for this.</para>

C:\>net use L: \\teacher0\pubwrite
net use L: \\teacher0\pubwrite
The command completed successfully.

<section><title>test writing with windows</title>
	<para>We mounted the <command>pubwrite</command> share on the L: drive in windows. Below we test that we can write to this share.</para>
	<screen>
L:\&#062;echo hoi &#062; hoi.txt

L:\&#062;dir
 Volume in drive L is pubwrite
 Volume Serial Number is 0C82-272A

 Directory of L:\

21/01/2009  06:11    &#060;DIR&#062;          ..
21/01/2009  06:16                 6 hoi.txt
               1 File(s)              6 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  13.496.238.080 bytes free

<section><title>How is this possible ?</title>
	<para>Linux (or any Unix) always needs a user account to gain access to a system. The windows computer did not provide the samba server with a user account or a password. Instead, the Linux owner of the files created through this writable share is the Linux guest account (usually named nobody).</para>
	<screen>
[root@RHEL52 samba]# ls -l /srv/samba/writable/
total 4
-rwxr--r-- 1 nobody nobody 6 Jan 21 06:16 hoi.txt
	</screen>
	<para>So this is not the cleanest solution. We will need to improve this.</para>
