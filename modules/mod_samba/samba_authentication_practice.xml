	<screen>useradd -c 'SMB user1' userx</screen>
	<screen>passwd userx</screen>
	<para>2. Set up a shared directory that is only accessible to authenticated users.</para>
	<screen>The shared section in smb.conf could look like this:</screen>
	<screen>
[authwrite]
 path = /srv/samba/authwrite
 comment = authenticated users only
 read only = no  
 guest ok = no
	</screen>
	<para>3. Use smbclient and a windows computer to access your share, use more than one user account (windows requires a logoff/logon for this).</para>
	<screen>on Linux: smbclient //studentX/authwrite -U user1 password</screen>
	<screen>on windows net use p: \\studentX\authwrite password /user:user2</screen>
	<para>4. Verify that files created by these users belong to them.</para>

	<para>5. Try to change or delete a file from another user.</para>
