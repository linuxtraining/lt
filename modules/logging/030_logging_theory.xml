Syslog was developed by <command>Eric Allman</command><indexterm><primary>Eric Allman</primary></indexterm> for sendmail, but quickly became a standard among many Unix applications and was much later written as rfc 3164. The syslog daemon can receive messages on udp <command>port 514</command> from many applications (and appliances), and can append to log files, print, display messages on terminals and forward logs to other syslogd daemons on other machines. The syslogd daemon is configured in <command>/etc/syslog.conf</command><indexterm><primary>/etc/syslog.conf</primary></indexterm>.</para>

			<para>Each line in the configuration file uses a <command>facility</command> to determine where the message is coming from. It also contains a <command>priority</command> for the severity of the message, and an <command>action</command> to decide on what to do with the message.</para>
