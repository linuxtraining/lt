	<section><title>seven OSI layers</title>
		<para>When talking about protocol layers, people usually mention the seven layers of the <command>osi</command> protocol (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link and Physical). We will discuss layers 2 and 3 in depth, and focus less on the other layers. The reason is that these layers are important for understanding networks. You will hear administrators use words like "this is a layer 2 device" or "this is a layer 3 broadcast", and you should be able to understand what they are talking about.</para>

	<section><title>four DoD layers</title>
		<para>The <command>DoD</command> (or tcp/ip) model has only four layers, roughly mapping its <command>network access layer</command> to OSI layers 1 and 2 (Physical and Datalink), its <command>internet</command> (IP) layer to the OSI <command>network layer</command>, its <command>host-to-host</command> (tcp, udp) layer to OSI layer 4 (transport) and its <command>application layer</command> to OSI layers 5, 6 and 7.</para>
		<para>Below an attempt to put OSI and DoD layers next to some protocols and devices.</para>

	<section><title>short introduction to the physical layer</title>
		<para>The physical layer, or <command>layer 1</command>, is all about voltage, electrical signals and mechanical connections. Some networks might still use <command>coax</command> cables, but most will have migrated to <command>utp</command> (cat 5 or better) with <command>rj45</command> connectors.</para>
		<para>Devices like <command>repeaters</command> and <command>hubs</command> are part of this layer. You cannot use software to 'see' a <command>repeater</command> or <command>hub</command> on the network. The only thing these devices are doing is amplifying electrical signals on cables. <command>Passive hubs</command> are multiport amplifiers that amplify an incoming electrical signal on all other connections. <command>Active hubs</command> do this by reading and retransmitting bits, without interpreting any meaning in those bits.</para>
		<para>Network technologies like <command>csma/cd</command> and <command>token ring</command> are defined on this layer.</para>
		<para>This is all we have to say about <command>layer 1</command> in this book.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>short introduction to the data link layer</title>
		<para>The data link layer, or <command>layer 2</command> is about frames. A frame has a <command>crc</command> (cyclic redundancy check). In the case of ethernet (802.3), each network card is identifiable by a unique 48-bit <command>mac</command> address (media access control address).</para>
		<para>On this layer we find devices like bridges and switches. A bridge is more intelligent than a hub because a <command>bridge</command> can make decisions based on the mac address of computers. A <command>switch</command> also understands mac addresses.</para>
		<para>In this book we will discuss commands like <command>arp</command> and <command>ifconfig</command> to explore this layer.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>short introduction to the network layer</title>
		<para><command>Layer 3</command> is about ip packets. This layer gives every host a unique 32-bit ip address. But <command>ip</command> is not the only protocol on this layer, there is also icmp, igmp, ipv6 and more. A complete list can be found in the <command>/etc/protocols</command> file.</para>
		<para>On this layer we find devices like <command>routers</command> and layer 3 switches, devices that know (and have) an ip address.</para>
		<para>In tcp/ip this layer is commonly referred to as the <command>internet layer</command>.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>short introduction to the transport layer</title>
		<para>We will discuss the <command>tcp</command> and <command>udp</command> protocols in the context of layer 4. The DoD model calls this the host-to-host layer.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>layers 5, 6 and 7 </title>
		<para>The tcp/ip application layer includes layers 5, 6 and 7. Details on the difference between these layers are out of scope of this course.</para>

	<section><title>network layers in this book</title>
		<para>Stacking of layers in this book is based on the <command>Protocols in Frame</command> explanation in the <command>wireshark</command> sniffer. When sniffing a dhcp packet, we notice the following in the sniffer.</para>
		<screen>[Protocols in Frame: eth:ip:udp:bootp]</screen>
		<para>Sniffing for ntp (Network Time Protocol) packets gives us this line, which makes us conclude to put <command>ntp</command> next to <command>bootp</command> in the protocol chart below.</para>
		<screen>[Protocols in Frame: eth:ip:udp:ntp]</screen>
		<para>Sniffing an <command>arp</command> broadcast makes us put arp next to <command>ip</command>. All these protocols are explained later in this chapter.</para>
		<screen>[Protocols in Frame: eth:arp]</screen>
		<para>Below is a protocol chart based on wireshark's knowledge. It contains some very common protocols that are discussed in this book. The chart does not contain all protocols.</para>

		<para>Typical example here is the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) broadcasting to everyone. In datacommunications a broadcast is most common confined to the <command>lan</command>.</para>
		<para>Careful, a <command>layer 2 broadcast</command> is very different from a <command>layer 3 broadcast</command>. A layer two broadcast is received by all network cards on the same segment (it does not pass any router), whereas a layer 3 broadcast is received by all hosts in the same ip subnet.</para>

<section><title>lan-wan-man</title>
	<para>The term <command>lan</command> is used for local area networks, as opposed to a <command>wan</command> for wide area networks. The difference between the two is determined by the <command>distance</command> between the computers, and not by the number of computers in a network. Some protocols like <command>atm</command> are designed for use in a <command>wan</command>, others like <command>ethernet</command> are designed for use in a <command>lan</command>.</para>
	<section><title>lan</title>
		<para>A <command>lan </command><indexterm><primary>LAN</primary></indexterm> (Local Area Network) is a local network. This can be one room, or one floor, or even one big building. We say <command>lan</command> as long as computers are <command>close</command> to each other. You can also define a <command>lan</command> when all computers are <command>ethernet</command> connected.</para>
		<para>A <command>lan</command> can contain multiple smaller <command>lan</command>'s. The picture below shows three <command>lan</command>'s that together make up one <command>lan</command>.</para>

	<section><title>wan</title>
		<para>A <command>wan</command><indexterm><primary>WAN</primary></indexterm> (Wide Area Network) is a network with a lot of distance between the computers (or hosts). These hosts are often connected by <command>leased lines</command>. A <command>wan</command> does not use <command>ethernet</command>, but protocols like <command>fddi</command><indexterm><primary>fddi</primary></indexterm>, <command>frame relay</command><indexterm><primary>frame relay</primary></indexterm>, <command>ATM</command><indexterm><primary>atm</primary></indexterm> or <command>X.25</command><indexterm><primary>X.25</primary></indexterm> to connect computers (and networks).</para>

<section><title>internet - intranet - extranet</title>
	<para>The <command>internet</command> is a global network. It connects many networks using the <command>tcp/ip</command> protocol stack.</para>
	<para>The origin of the <command>internet</command> is the <command>arpanet</command>. The <command>arpanet</command> was created in 1969, that year only four computers were connected in the network. In 1971 the first <command>e-mail</command> was sent over the <command>arpanet</command>. <command>E-mail</command> took 75 percent of all <command>arpanet</command> traffic in 1973. 1973 was also the year <command>ftp</command> was introduced, and saw the connection of the first European countries (Norway and UK). In 2009 the internet was available to 25 percent of the world population. In 2011 it is estimated that only a quarter of internet webpages are in English.</para>
	<para>An <command>intranet</command> is a private <command>tcp/ip</command> network. An <command>intranet</command> uses the same protocols as the <command>internet</command>, but is only accessible to people from within one organization.</para>
	<para>An <command>extranet</command> is similar to an <command>intranet</command>, but some trusted organizations (partners/clients/suppliers/...) also get access.</para>

<section><title>tcp/ip</title>
	<section><title>history of tcp/ip</title>
		<para>In the Sixties development of the <command>tcp/ip</command> protocol stack was started by the US Department of Defense. In the Eighties a lot of commercial enterprises developed their own protocol stack: IBM created <command>sna</command>, Novell had <command>ipx/spx</command>, Microsoft completed <command>netbeui</command> and Apple worked with <command>appletalk</command>. All the efforts from the Eighties failed to survive the Nineties. By the end of the Nineties, almost all computers in the world were able to speak tcp/ip.</para>
		<para>In my humble opinion, the main reason for the survival of <command>tcp/ip</command> over all the other protocols is its openness. Everyone is free to develop and use the tcp/ip protocol suite.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>rfc (request for comment)</title>
		<para>The protocols that are used on the internet are defined in <command>rfc's</command>. An rfc or <command>request for comment</command> describes the inner working of all internet protocols. The <command>IETF</command> (Internet Engineering Task Force) is the sole publisher of these protocols since 1986.</para>
		<para>The official website for the rfc's is <command>http://www.rfc-editor.org</command>. This website contains all rfc's in plain text, for example rfc2132 (which defines dhcp and bootp) is accessible at http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt.</para>
