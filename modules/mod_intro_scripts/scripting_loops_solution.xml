	<para>1. Write a script that uses a <command>for</command> loop to count from 3 to 7.</para>
	<screen>#!/bin/bash

for i in 3 4 5 6 7
do
 echo Counting from 3 to 7, now at $i
done</screen>
	<para>2. Write a script that uses a <command>for</command> loop to count from 1 to 17000.</para>
	<screen>#!/bin/bash

for i in `seq 1 17000`
do
 echo Counting from 1 to 17000, now at $i
done</screen>
	<para>3. Write a script that uses a <command>while</command> loop to count from 3 to 7.</para>
	<screen>#!/bin/bash

i=3
while [ $i -le 7 ]
do
 echo Counting from 3 to 7, now at $i
 let i=i+1
done</screen>
	<para>4. Write a script that uses an <command>until</command> loop to count down from 8 to 4.</para>
	<screen>#!/bin/bash

i=8
until [ $i -lt 4 ]
do
 echo Counting down from 8 to 4, now at $i
 let i=i-1
done</screen>
	<para>5. Write a script that counts the number of files ending in <command>.txt</command> in the current directory.</para>
	<screen>#!/bin/bash

let i=0
for file in *.txt
do
	let i++
done
echo "There are $i files ending in .txt"
	</screen>
	<para>6. Wrap an <command>if</command> statement around the script so it is also correct when there are zero files ending in <command>.txt</command>.</para>
	<screen>#!/bin/bash

ls *.txt > /dev/null 2>&#038;1
if [ $? -ne 0 ] 
then echo "There are 0 files ending in .txt"
else
	let i=0
	for file in *.txt
	do
		let i++
	done
	echo "There are $i files ending in .txt"
fi</screen>
