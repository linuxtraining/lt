<para><command>This chapter shows a Ubuntu install in Virtualbox. Consider it legacy and use CentOS8 or Debian10 instead (each have their own chapter now).</command></para>
<para>This book assumes you have access to a working Linux computer. Most companies have one or more Linux servers, if you have already logged on to it, then you 're all set (skip this chapter and go to the next).</para>
<para>Another option is to insert a Ubuntu Linux CD in a computer with (or without) Microsoft Windows and follow the installation. Ubuntu will resize (or create) partitions and setup a menu at boot time to choose Windows or Linux.</para>
<para>If you do not have access to a Linux computer at the moment, and if you are unable or unsure about installing Linux on your computer, then this chapter proposes a third option: installing Linux in a virtual machine.</para>
<para>Installation in a virtual machine (provided by <command>Virtualbox</command>) is easy and safe. Even when you make mistakes and crash everything on the virtual Linux machine, then nothing on the real computer is touched.</para>
<para>This chapter gives easy steps and screenshots to get a working Ubuntu server in a Virtualbox virtual machine. The steps are very similar to installing Fedora or CentOS or even Debian, and if you like you can also use VMWare instead of Virtualbox.</para>
