<para>Security Enhanced Linux or <command>SELinux</command><indexterm><primary>SELinux</primary></indexterm> is a set of modifications developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) to provide a variety of security policies for Linux. SELinux was released as open source at the end of 2000. Since kernel version 2.6 it is an integrated part of Linux.</para>
<para>SELinux offers security! SELinux can control what kind of access users have to files and processes. Even when a file received <command>chmod 777</command>, SELinux can still prevent applications from accessing it (Unix file permissions are checked first!). SELinux does this by placing users in <command>roles</command> that represent a security context. Administrators have very strict control on access permissions granted to roles.</para>
<para>SELinux is present in the latest versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, and many other distributions..</para>
